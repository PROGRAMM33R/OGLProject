## BachelorProject
Project for Bachelor thesis - VÅ B-TUO university @ 2018

### Description
Crowd simulation of Boid's algorithm. The project was separated into two parts:
* **evacuation simulation** - people are evacuated from pre-defined schema of building, which can be modified in *map.txt*
* **flock simulation** - simulation of flock *(in this project fishes)*, it's pure boid's algorithm

More informations about project are in [BachelorText repository](https://github.com/pr033r/BachelorText/blob/master/main.pdf).
